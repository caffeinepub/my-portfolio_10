# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a visible "Email Me" button in the Contact section that opens the visitor's default email client pre-addressed to pranaavsanjith@gmail.com.

**Planned changes:**
- Add an "Email Me" button in the Contact section using a `mailto:pranaavsanjith@gmail.com` href
- Style the button consistently with the existing midnight-violet dark theme (colors, typography, border radius)
- Place the button visibly within the contact area alongside the existing form and social links

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can click the "Email Me" button in the Contact section to instantly open their default email client with pranaavsanjith@gmail.com pre-filled in the To field, on both desktop and mobile.
